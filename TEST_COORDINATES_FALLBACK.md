# COORDINATES Fallback Implementation - Test Guide

## What Was Implemented

The COORDINATES fallback mechanism has been implemented in both `beams.py` and `columns.py` to handle **ETABS mesh intersection nodes** that appear in `$ POINT COORDINATES` but not in `$ POINT ASSIGNS`.

### Problem Identified

**Example**: Point "60" used by beam B444:
- ✅ EXISTS in POINT COORDINATES: `(67.4, 26.15)`
- ❌ MISSING from POINT ASSIGNS: `NOT FOUND`
- ❌ Result: Beam B444 skipped at 5 stories with error "endpoint(s) not present on this story"

This occurs when ETABS AUTOMESH/MESHATINTERSECTIONS creates geometric intersections that are only topologically integrated in post-analysis exports.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`src/model_building/beams.py`** (lines 318-426)
   - Modified `_ensure_node_for()` to accept fallback parameters
   - Added Priority 1 (POINT ASSIGNS) and Priority 2 (COORDINATES fallback) logic
   - Modified `define_beams()` to load COORDINATES and story elevations
   - Updated function calls to pass fallback data

2. **`src/model_building/columns.py`** (lines 183-553)
   - Applied identical modifications as beams.py
   - Handles both Method 1 (vertical columns) and Method 2 (multi-point columns)

### How It Works

```python
def _ensure_node_for(pid, sname, sidx, act_pt_map, existing_nodes,
                     point_coords_fallback, story_elevations):
    # Priority 1: Try POINT ASSIGNS (from active_points)
    if (pid, sname) in act_pt_map:
        x, y, z = act_pt_map[(pid, sname)]
        create_node(tag, x, y, z)
        return tag

    # Priority 2: Fallback to POINT COORDINATES + story elevation
    if pid in point_coords_fallback and sname in story_elevations:
        x, y = point_coords_fallback[pid]  # From COORDINATES
        z = story_elevations[sname]         # From story elevation
        create_node(tag, x, y, z)
        print(f"[COORDINATES FALLBACK] Node {tag} for point {pid}")
        return tag

    # Point doesn't exist anywhere
    return None
```

### Node Tagging

For intersection nodes created via fallback:
- **Tag**: `point_id * 1000 + story_index`
- **Example**: Point 60 at story index 7 → Node tag `60007`

## How to Test

### Prerequisites

Install missing BLAS libraries (you have sudo access):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libblas3 liblapack3 libopenblas-base
```

### Test Command

```bash
# Rebuild model with COORDINATES fallback
python3 build_and_validate.py
```

### Expected Results

#### Before (Current out/beams.json from Oct 15):
```json
"skips": [
  "B444 @ '11_P6' skipped — endpoint(s) not present on this story",
  "B444 @ '08_P5' skipped — endpoint(s) not present on this story",
  "B444 @ '04_P4' skipped — endpoint(s) not present on this story",
  "B444 @ '04_P3' skipped — endpoint(s) not present on this story",
  "B444 @ '02_P2' skipped — endpoint(s) not present on this story"
]
```

#### After (Expected with COORDINATES fallback):
```bash
# Console output during build:
[beams] Processing story 11_P6...
  [COORDINATES FALLBACK] Node 60011 for point 60 at story 11_P6: (67.40, 26.15, Z)
[beams] Beam B444 @ '11_P6' created successfully

[beams] Processing story 08_P5...
  [COORDINATES FALLBACK] Node 60008 for point 60 at story 08_P5: (67.40, 26.15, Z)
[beams] Beam B444 @ '08_P5' created successfully

... (similar for other stories)
```

**Expected Changes**:
1. ✅ Beam B444 should be CREATED at all 5 stories (not skipped)
2. ✅ "[COORDINATES FALLBACK]" messages in console output
3. ✅ Nodes 60002, 60003, 60004, 60005, 60008, 60011 should exist
4. ✅ `out/beams.json` should show B444 elements instead of skips
5. ✅ Validation should show improved connectivity

### Verification Steps

1. **Check skip count reduced**:
   ```bash
   # Before
   grep -c "B444.*skipped" out/beams.json
   # Expected: 5

   # After rebuild
   grep -c "B444.*skipped" out/beams.json
   # Expected: 0
   ```

2. **Check B444 elements created**:
   ```bash
   grep "B444" out/beams.json | grep -c "\"line\": \"B444\""
   # Expected: 5 (one per story)
   ```

3. **Run validation**:
   ```bash
   python3 validation/opensees_model_validator.py
   ```
   Expected improvements:
   - Fewer disconnected components
   - Better connectivity
   - Fewer skipped elements

## Technical Insight

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Why This Problem Exists**:
- ETABS AUTOMESH creates geometric intersections without topological connectivity
- Post-analysis exports partition elements and create intersection nodes
- These nodes exist physically (COORDINATES) but not logically (ASSIGNS)
- The translator must infer Z-coordinates from story elevations

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Two-priority fallback: ASSIGNS first (authoritative), then COORDINATES
- Per-story node creation: Same XY, different Z = different nodes
- Explicit logging: "[COORDINATES FALLBACK]" for debugging
- Backward compatible: Existing models unaffected
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

## Current Status

✅ **Implementation Complete**:
- [x] Modified `beams.py` with COORDINATES fallback
- [x] Modified `columns.py` with COORDINATES fallback
- [x] Parser already extracts POINT COORDINATES (e2k_parser.py:426-444)
- [x] Verified point 60 exists in COORDINATES but not ASSIGNS

⏳ **Testing Blocked**:
- [ ] BLAS libraries not installed (missing libblas.so.3)
- [ ] Cannot run OpenSeesPy model build
- [ ] You need to install dependencies and rebuild

## Next Steps

1. Install BLAS libraries (command above)
2. Run `python3 build_and_validate.py`
3. Check console for "[COORDINATES FALLBACK]" messages
4. Verify B444 beams are created (not skipped)
5. Run validation to confirm improved connectivity
6. Compare node counts and element counts before/after

## Files to Review After Test

- `out/beams.json` - Should show B444 elements, not skips
- `out/columns.json` - May also show fallback usage
- `out/nodes.json` - Should include nodes like 60002, 60003, etc.
- Console output - Look for "[COORDINATES FALLBACK]" messages

## Troubleshooting

If fallback doesn't trigger:
1. Check `out/parsed_raw.json` has point in "points" section
2. Check `out/story_graph.json` elevation exists for story
3. Check console for error messages
4. Verify point ID format matches (string vs int)
