# nodes.py
"""
Define OpenSeesPy nodes from Phase-1 artifacts.

Key points:
- There are no global "free" explicit-Z nodes. If a point has a third value `d`,
  then at each story S where it appears:
      Z = Z_story(S) - d
  We therefore create a grid node per (point, story) as needed, using the grid tag rule.

- Tagging:
  Grid node tag: int(point_id) * 1000 + story_index (top=0).
  (We keep node_tag_free available in tagging.py for other cases, but do not use it here.)
